"""
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: 
    â€œThe lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants 
    (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).
