"""
You are given a 0-indexed array nums of length n, consisting of non-negative integers. For each index i from 0 to n - 1, 
    you must determine the size of the minimum sized non-empty subarray of nums starting at i (inclusive) 
        that has the maximum possible bitwise OR.
In other words, let Bij be the bitwise OR of the subarray nums[i...j]. You need to find the smallest subarray starting at i, 
    such that bitwise OR of this subarray is equal to max(Bik) where i <= k <= n - 1.
The bitwise OR of an array is the bitwise OR of all the numbers in it.
Return an integer array answer of size n where answer[i] is the length of the minimum sized subarray starting at i with maximum bitwise OR.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
