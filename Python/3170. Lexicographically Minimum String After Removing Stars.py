You are given a string s. It may contain any number of '*' characters. Your task is to remove all '*' characters.
While there is a '*', do the following operation:
â€¢ Delete the leftmost '*' and the smallest non-'*' character to its left. If there are several smallest characters, you can delete any of them.
Return the lexicographically smallest resulting string after removing all '*' characters.
